    "# Introduction: Chope is the largest online reservations platform in Southeast Asia. It offers users the ability to instantly reserve restaurants on a 24/7 basis and recently introduced restaurant voucher sales as an e-commerce initiative. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: Predict which reservation will lead to voucher purchase(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this objective? \n",
    "### Restaurant voucher sales are of strategic importance because:\n",
    "* It represents additional revenues to restaurants on the platform\n",
    "* It helps to reduce the no-show rate of reservations\n",
    "* It encourages users to try out new restaurants that they otherwise might not try- introducing a discovery utility to the platform\n",
    "* It increases user satisfaction by offering them a good deal and potentially expands their lifetime value\n",
    "* It provides Chope with a very cheap source of short-term working capital \n",
    "\n",
    "### General workflow:\n",
    "* Obtain reservation raw data and voucher purchase raw data\n",
    "* Parse and clean data\n",
    "* Link reservation occurence to voucher purchase through a set of pre-defined conditions\n",
    "* Assess features' importance of reservation and voucher purchase data\n",
    "* Split data into training and testing sets using cross-validation method\n",
    "* Apply data to classification prediction models and machine learning tools\n",
    "* Optimise model's precision/ recall by fine tuning parameters\n",
    "* Make recommendations on data models based on results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models to apply:\n",
    "* Logistic regression\n",
    "* XGboost\n",
    "* Keras Neural Network: Sequential\n"
